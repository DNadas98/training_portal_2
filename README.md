## About The Project

The Training Portal project is a comprehensive learning and examination platform for organizational
training. It supports dynamic content management, allowing administrators to manage educational
materials including texts and videos, alongside customizable exam forms with variable question types
and answer options. The learning materials and tests are organized to projects inside the groups, allowing
for simplified management of start and deadline dates, user access and various other properties. The
system keeps track of user progress, allowing employees to keep track of their progress and also
administrators to see the overall progress of a project.

#### Features
- Secure account handling with e-mail verified registration and password reset, and update options for account details
- Comprehensive access control with global roles and various group and project level permissions and join request system to groups and projects.
- Questionnaire / test system for projects
  - Dynamic editor that uses drag-and-drop components for questions and answers, and what-you-see-is-what-you-get rich-text editors for text inputs.
  - A test submission page for project members, where they can fill out active questionnaires
- Fully responsible design using Material UI components
- Localization of texts, dates, inputs and notifications (hungarian texts  are work in progress)
- Pagination, sort and search features, ligh-dark mode
- A project administrator permission manager page and a questionnaire submission statistics page.
- Group permission manager, system administrator user and group manager pages are work in progress.

## Getting Started

### Deployment

The Dockerfiles for the different modules use multiple stage builds. The built Docker images are
collected by a Docker Compose configuration. The database is also built here from the official
PostgreSQL image.
The project uses Nginx as reverse-proxy and static file server.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for the Docker Compose setup
  - The project builds and starts with Docker Compose. Java, Node, Vite JS are only required
    for development
- Optional: [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21)
  - The project uses Java 21 and Java Spring 3.2.0
- Optional: [Node.js, NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
  - The frontend is developed using Node version 21
  - The frontend project is set up using [Vite JS](https://vitejs.dev/)

### Setup & Run

- Copy `env.txt` template and rename to `.env`, modify values (see details in the
  template)
- Copy `frontend/env.txt` template and rename to `.env`, values can be left as is, this one contains
  no secrets, only configuration options
- Optional: SSL Certificates
  - Replace `ssl/fake-ssl-cert` and `ssl/fake-ssl-key` with real certificates
  - Modify SSL copy lines in `nginx/Dockerfile`
  - Modify SSL configuration in `nginx/nginx.conf`
    <br><br>
- Run `docker compose up -d` in the project root to start the project with Docker Compose,
- OR for <strong> development mode</strong>
  - Run the development database in the `docker-compose.dev.yml`
  - Start the spring boot application in "dev" profile (the default Spring profile)
  - From the frontend folder, start the javascript application using `npm run dev`
    <br><br>
- Access the application at [`https://localhost:4430`](https://localhost:4430) (by default)
  <br><br>
- Run `docker compose logs -f` in the project root to view the logs
  - The backend API has different logging level for "dev" and "prod" profiles.  
    A more verbose setting is useful during development.
- See `backend/Dockerfile` and `nginx/Dockerfile` for build details

## Usage

### Configuration

- ENVs: `.env` files in the root folder and in `frontend` folder
- API configuration: `backend/src/main/resources/application-*.yml`
- Frontend configuration: `frontend/vite.config.js`
- Nginx reverse proxy configuration: `nginx/nginx.conf`

### Authentication, authorization

The application supports local sign-ups and sign-ins. The application requires email verification.
Users must verify their email
through a sent link to activate their accounts, ensuring authenticity and reducing unauthorized
access. Other account-related procedures, like username and password change, e-mail address change, 
forgotten password are also securely implemented.

The backend API uses JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. After a successful login at the
Login endpoint, the user receives a Bearer Token in the response body, and a Refresh Token
as a cookie named `jwt`. This cookie is HTTPOnly, SameSite = "strict", Secure)<br><br>
Secured endpoints can be accessed by supplying the Bearer Token in the Authorization
header as "Bearer ".
If the access token has expired, a new access token can be requested using the Refresh
endpoint, as long as the Refresh Token is still valid and available as a cookie.<br><br>
The Spring API's security has advanced from a basic RBAC system to a more complex model, integrating
global Spring Security roles and specific permission types with custom security at the method level.
This approach enables detailed access control based on the application's unique needs.

Security for endpoints is managed by global roles, such as "USER" and "ADMIN". For example, only
users with the ADMIN role can access /api/v1/admin endpoints,
while /api/v1/user and similar paths are open to users with the USER role, safeguarding
administrative functions.

A custom permission evaluation system has also been developed, utilizing PermissionType to
dynamically determine access rights based on the request's context, targeted objects, and user
permissions. This system allows setting specific access rules for actions on entities like
companies, projects, and tasks, based on the authenticated user's permissions.

For instance, access to or modification of a userGroup, project, or task depends not only on a
user's
global role but also on permissions such as COMPANY_ADMIN, PROJECT_EDITOR, or
TASK_ASSIGNED_EMPLOYEE, reflecting the user's specific relationship with the entity.

This enhanced security model improves the API's flexibility and security, enabling the definition of
complex access control policies to meet the application's varied requirements, forming a strong
basis for authentication and authorization management.


Rate limits are also applied and database backup, log management and monitoring are also set up in the real deployment environment. The firewall, ssh-only login with fail2ban and other safety measures are also configured.
